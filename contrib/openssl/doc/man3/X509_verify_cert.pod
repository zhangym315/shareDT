=head1 NAME

X509_verify_cert - discover and verify X509 certificate chain

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 int X509_verify_cert(X509_STORE_CTX *ctx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The X509_verify_cert() function attempts to discover and validate a
certificate chain based on parameters in B<ctx>.
The verification context, of type B<X509_STORE_CTX>, can be constructed
using L<X509_STORE_CTX_new(3)> and L<X509_STORE_CTX_init(3)>.
It usually includes a set of certificates serving as trust anchors,
a set of non-trusted certificates that may be needed for chain construction,
flags such as X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT, and various other optional components
such as a callback function that allows customizing the verification outcome.
A complete description of the certificate verification process is contained in
the L<openssl-verify(1)> manual page.

Applications rarely call this function directly but it is used by
OpenSSL internally for certificate validation, in both the S/MIME and
SSL/TLS code.

A negative return value from X509_verify_cert() can occur if it is invoked
incorrectly, such as with no certificate set in B<ctx>, or when it is called
twice in succession without reinitialising B<ctx> for the second call.
A negative return value can also happen due to internal resource problems or if
a retry operation is requested during internal lookups (which never happens
with standard lookup methods).
Applications must check for <= 0 return value on error.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If a complete chain can be built and validated this function returns 1,
otherwise it return zero, in exceptional circumstances it can also
return a negative code.

If the function fails additional error information can be obtained by
examining B<ctx> using, for example L<X509_STORE_CTX_get_error(3)>.

=head1 BUGS

This function uses the header F<< <x509.h> >>
as opposed to most chain verification
functions which use F<< <x509_vfy.h> >>.
